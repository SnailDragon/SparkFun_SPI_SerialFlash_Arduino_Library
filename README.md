# SparkFun SPI SerialFlash Arduino Library

We wrote this library to help with configuring the flash memory on our products during production testing. We've made it public just in case you find it useful too.

This library can be installed via the Arduino Library manager. Search for **SparkFun SPI SerialFlash**.

If you need filesystem-like access to SPI Flash memory, check out [Paul Stoffregen's Serial Flash Library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/SerialFlash).
